<p style="text-align: justify;" >Dear hiring manager,</p> 
    <p style="text-align: justify;" >I am writing to express my interest in the Project Management Assistant position which I found on Dynamitejobs.com. I believe my experience and skills make me an excellent fit for this role. 
        </p>


<p style="text-align: justify;" >In 2020 I graduated with a degree in Management and Human Resources. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work as an HR intern where I gained valuable experience in Recruitment and Organizational development. 
After completing my studies, I joined an HR consultancy firm where I was able to work on a variety of projects, including strategic planning and implementation of Organizational culture and work environment surveys. This experience allowed me to work  with a diverse range of businesses and collaborate with managers at various levels. </p>
Currently, I am the manager of a dental clinic in Playa del Carmen, where I oversee a range of responsibilities including finance, human resources, marketing, inventory management, and customer service. I am constantly striving to ensure that all aspects of the clinic are operating efficiently and that our patients receive the highest level of care. This position has allowed me to understand the importance of processes and their documentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" >I am excited about the opportunity to join your company and contribute my knowledge, skills, and dedication to the team, and learn everything I can with you to keep improving. I read about your culture and being able to identify with your values is a great first step for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" >Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.</p>
